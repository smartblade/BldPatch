/* Newfangled version identification scheme.

   This scheme was added in Python 1.5.2b2; before that time, only PATCHLEVEL
   was available.  To test for presence of the scheme, test for
   defined(PY_MAJOR_VERSION).

   When the major or minor version changes, the VERSION variable in
   configure.in must also be changed.

   There is also (independent) API version information in modsupport.h.
